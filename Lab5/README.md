This is a semester Project for CSUF CPSC 462 Software Design during the Spring of 2023.

I created a Hotel Reservation System called "Hotel-Easy", and delivered artifacts for the
inception phase and elaboration phase.

For the code demo of elaboration phase the professor required his exact Logging to be implemented.
I used the Professor's UI, Persistence, and main.cpp with changes specific to my implementation
of a hotel reservation system.

Artifacts folder is just a collection of deliverables that I completed through the semester.
It consists of documentation docs, UML diagrams, and a video demo required for the class.
Nothing in Artifacts folder is compiled for the "system".

Build.sh is the professor's script for specific compiler flags that he required for the class.
